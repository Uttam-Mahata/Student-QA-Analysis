Following the Green Revolution, India experienced several economic and social reforms aimed at improving various aspects of society. One notable initiative was the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), launched in 2005 under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. This program aimed to provide job opportunities to rural households by guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment per year. The idea was to alleviate poverty and unemployment in rural areas by offering manual labor jobs like road construction, water conservation, and irrigation projects.

MGNREGA was intended to address the challenges of rural poverty and distress migration by providing a safety net for vulnerable populations. However, while the program has provided employment to millions of rural households, its implementation has faced criticism and challenges. Some argue that MGNREGA has led to dependency on government assistance rather than promoting sustainable livelihoods. Additionally, there have been concerns about corruption, delays in wage payments, and the quality of assets created under the scheme.

Another significant reform post-Green Revolution was the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017. Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, GST aimed to streamline India's complex tax system by replacing multiple indirect taxes with a single unified tax. The goal was to create a common national market, reduce tax evasion, and promote ease of doing business. However, the rollout of GST encountered various challenges, including technical glitches in the GST Network portal and resistance from some states over revenue-sharing issues.

While GST was intended to simplify the tax regime and promote economic growth, its implementation has been marred by complexities and compliance issues. The multiplicity of tax rates and compliance requirements have posed challenges for businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in adapting to the new tax system. Moreover, the initial disruption caused by GST implementation impacted supply chains and business operations, leading to concerns about its short-term economic impact.

In conclusion, the post-Green Revolution era in India witnessed significant economic and social reforms such as MGNREGA and GST. While these initiatives aimed to address key challenges and promote inclusive growth, their effectiveness and impact have been subject to debate. While MGNREGA has provided employment opportunities to rural households, concerns remain about its long-term sustainability and governance issues. Similarly, while GST has sought to simplify the tax regime and enhance economic efficiency, challenges in implementation have raised questions about its effectiveness in achieving its objectives. Overall, these reforms highlight the complexities and challenges inherent in driving socio-economic transformation in a diverse and dynamic country like India.
