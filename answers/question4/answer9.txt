India has seen notable economic and social reforms since the Green Revolution, albeit with varying degrees of success and depth. The liberalization policies of 1991, led by then-Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh and Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, aimed to transition India towards a more market-oriented economy. These reforms included the dismantling of trade barriers and encouraging foreign investment, resulting in increased GDP growth rates and greater integration into the global economy.

In the agricultural sector, despite the significant strides made since the Green Revolution, challenges persist. Policies such as the National Agricultural Policy of 2000 and initiatives like the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) aimed to address these challenges by promoting sustainable agriculture and enhancing rural livelihoods.

Social reforms have also been a key focus area in India's development journey. The enactment of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2005 aimed to provide wage employment to rural households, thereby alleviating poverty and empowering rural communities. While MGNREGA has been lauded as one of the largest social security schemes globally, its implementation has faced challenges such as corruption and leakages, affecting its effectiveness in reaching the intended beneficiaries. 

Furthermore, efforts towards gender equality and social inclusion have been made through various legislative measures and affirmative action policies. Laws such as the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act and the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act have aimed to protect women's rights and promote gender equality. Additionally, affirmative action policies such as reservations for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) have been implemented to address historical injustices.

In conclusion, India's journey of economic and social reforms since the Green Revolution reflects a mixed bag of achievements and challenges. While significant strides have been made in various sectors, including agriculture, social welfare, and gender equality, issues such as income disparities, agrarian distress, and implementation gaps persist. Moving forward, addressing these challenges will be crucial for India to achieve inclusive and sustainable development, ensuring that the benefits of reforms reach all segments of society and pave the way for a brighter future for all its citizens.
