Since the Green Revolution, India has seen a slew of economic and social reforms that have left an indelible mark on the country's development landscape. One notable initiative was the introduction of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2005. This flagship social welfare program aimed to enhance the livelihood security of rural households by guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment per year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. Led by the then government under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, MGNREGA sought to address the issues of rural unemployment and poverty while also boosting rural infrastructure development.

Another significant reform was the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017. Spearheaded by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the GST aimed to streamline India's complex tax structure by replacing multiple indirect taxes levied by the central and state governments with a single tax regime. The GST was intended to simplify tax compliance, enhance tax revenues, promote ease of doing business, and create a unified national market. However, its implementation faced several challenges, including initial glitches in the GST Network portal and resistance from some state governments over revenue-sharing issues.

Both MGNREGA and GST have had profound implications for India's economic and social landscape. MGNREGA has helped alleviate rural poverty by providing employment opportunities to millions of rural households, thereby reducing distress migration and enhancing social inclusion. Moreover, the program has contributed to the creation of durable rural assets such as roads, ponds, and water conservation structures, which have improved rural infrastructure and livelihoods. However, criticisms have been leveled against MGNREGA, including issues related to corruption, leakages, delays in wage payments, and lack of productive assets creation.

Similarly, the implementation of GST has led to significant changes in India's tax architecture, fostering a more integrated and transparent indirect tax regime. By eliminating the cascading effect of taxes, GST has enhanced tax efficiency, reduced tax evasion, and widened the tax base. Moreover, GST has facilitated seamless interstate trade and reduced compliance burdens for businesses, leading to a more conducive environment for investment and economic growth. However, the complexities of GST compliance and the multiplicity of tax rates have posed challenges for businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in adapting to the new tax regime.

In conclusion, the implementation of reforms such as MGNREGA and GST since the Green Revolution has been instrumental in addressing key socio-economic challenges in India. While MGNREGA has provided a safety net for rural households and promoted asset creation in rural areas, GST has transformed India's tax landscape, promoting transparency and efficiency in indirect taxation. However, both reforms have encountered implementation challenges and criticism, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and refinement to maximize their impact on India's development journey.
