The economic and social reforms post the Green Revolution in India have been transformative, shaping the nation's development trajectory significantly.
One landmark reform was the liberalization of the economy in the early 1990s, led by Dr. Manmohan Singh and Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
This shift from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy through the New Economic Policy (NEP) marked a pivotal moment.
It included devaluation of the rupee, liberalization of trade and investment policies, and privatization of state-owned enterprises.
The liberalization measures catalyzed economic growth, attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), deregulating industries, and reducing trade barriers.
The Information Technology (IT) sector emerged as a key driver of growth, supported by infrastructure investments and outsourcing services.
Entrepreneurship flourished, fostering a dynamic startup ecosystem that generated jobs and wealth.
In tandem with economic reforms, social initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) aimed at providing rural employment and social security.
The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) promoted accessible healthcare and universal education, respectively.
Additionally, laws such as the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act and reservation policies empowered marginalized groups, addressing gender-based violence and discrimination.
Furthermore, environmental conservation gained prominence with initiatives like the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM).
These efforts not only promote sustainability but also enhance public health and economic productivity.
These reforms have propelled India's development, making it one of the fastest-growing economies globally.
Despite challenges, such as income inequality, the concerted efforts of policymakers, leaders, and civil society have laid a foundation for a more equitable and prosperous India.
