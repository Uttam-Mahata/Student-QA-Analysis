India has seen substantial economic and social reforms following the Green Revolution, shaping its development trajectory over the years.
One major economic reform post the Green Revolution was the liberalization of the economy in 1991. Spearheaded by then-Finance Minister Manmohan Singh and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, this policy aimed to open up the Indian economy to global markets, reduce trade barriers, and encourage foreign investment. It led to the dismantling of the License Raj, allowing for greater competition and efficiency in various sectors.

On the social front, the implementation of the Panchayati Raj system in the early 1990s was significant. This decentralized governance structure aimed to empower local communities by devolving power to grassroots-level institutions. It provided opportunities for local participation in decision-making and facilitated the efficient allocation of resources for rural development.

Another noteworthy social reform was the enactment of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) in 2005. This scheme, launched under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, guaranteed 100 days of wage employment to rural households, addressing poverty and unemployment in rural areas. It provided a safety net for vulnerable populations and stimulated rural economies.

In terms of economic reforms, the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017 was significant. This unified tax system aimed to simplify India's complex tax structure by replacing multiple indirect taxes with a single nationwide tax. Despite initial challenges, GST streamlined the tax regime, promoting ease of doing business and enhancing tax compliance.

Moreover, social initiatives like the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign, launched in 2015 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, focused on addressing gender inequality and promoting female education and empowerment. By raising awareness about gender-based discrimination and investing in girls' education and healthcare, the campaign aimed to improve the status of women in society.
These reforms have had mixed impacts on India's development. Economic liberalization contributed to rapid economic growth and increased foreign investment, but also led to rising income inequality and environmental degradation. Social reforms like the Panchayati Raj system and NREGA improved rural governance and livelihoods but faced challenges related to implementation and corruption. Similarly, while GST simplified the tax system, its implementation hurdles affected businesses, especially small traders. Initiatives like Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao raised awareness about gender inequality but faced challenges in changing societal attitudes and deep-rooted patriarchal norms.
Overall, the economic and social reforms implemented since the Green Revolution have shaped India's development journey. While they have brought about positive changes in various spheres, there remain challenges in ensuring inclusive and sustainable growth. Efforts to address these challenges through policy refinements and effective implementation will be crucial for India's continued progress in the years to come.
