So, like, after the Green Revolution in India, stuff got kinda crazy with some big changes and all, you know? One of the things that happened was this thing called the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, or MGNREGA for short. It happened in 2005 when Manmohan Singh was the big boss. So, what they did was they promised 100 days of work every year to people in rural areas. It was like, if you live in the countryside and don't have a job, don't worry, we got you covered. You can do some basic work like building roads or digging wells, and we'll pay you for it. Pretty cool, right?

Then, there's this other thing called the Goods and Services Tax, or GST. This one happened in 2017 when Narendra Modi was in charge. So, what they did was they wanted to make taxes easier for everyone, especially businesses. Instead of having different taxes for different things, they made this one tax for everything you buy or sell. Sounds simple, but trust me, it's not that simple. There were lots of problems when they first started it, like the computer system crashing and disagreements between the big bosses in different states.

Anyway, MGNREGA was supposed to help people in rural areas by giving them work and money, and GST was supposed to make taxes simpler and fairer for everyone. But, you know, things don't always go as planned. Some people say MGNREGA has helped a lot of poor people in the countryside, but others say there's a lot of corruption and the money doesn't always reach the people who need it the most. And with GST, well, some people say it's made things better for businesses and the economy, but others say it's too complicated and has made things harder, especially for small businesses.

So, yeah, after the Green Revolution, India tried to make things better with MGNREGA and GST, but whether they actually made things better or not, well, I guess it depends on who you ask. But hey, at least they're trying, right?
