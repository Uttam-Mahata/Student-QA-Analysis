The Green Revolution in India, initiated in the 1960s, marked a significant shift in agricultural practices aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in food production.
This revolution introduced key components like high-yielding variety (HYV) seeds, the application of fertilizers and chemicals, multiple cropping patterns, mechanization of farming, improved infrastructure facilities, price incentives, and better financial assistance through credit facilities

These changes led to a substantial increase in agriculture production within a short period, making India self-sufficient in food grains and eliminating the need for food imports.
The Green Revolution significantly improved productivity, generated employment opportunities, stabilized food grain prices, and strengthened linkages between agriculture and industry.
While the Green Revolution brought about positive outcomes such as increased agricultural production and self-sufficiency, it also had its share of challenges and criticisms.
One major issue was the widening income inequalities between rich and poor farmers due to unequal access to resources like irrigation water, fertilizers, seeds, and credit.
The revolution primarily benefited large landowners who could afford modern technologies, leading to disparities in income distribution.
Additionally, the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers had negative effects on soil health and land degradation.
The mechanization of farming further impacted employment opportunities for unskilled laborers.
The impact of the Green Revolution continues to influence India's agricultural landscape and policy decisions today.
Recent debates surrounding agricultural reforms have highlighted concerns about market-driven pricing mechanisms that may affect farmers' livelihoods negatively.
As India navigates the balance between agricultural modernization, sustainability, and equity, the legacy of the Green Revolution serves as a critical backdrop shaping the country's development trajectory.
