After the Green Revolution, India tried to fix some stuff, you know?
They came up with this Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2005.
It was all about giving people in rural areas some work and paying them for it.
They said, "Hey, if you're chilling in the countryside and need a job, we gotchu for like 100 days a year."
And then there was this Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017.
They wanted to make taxes less of a headache for everyone, especially businesses.
So, instead of having a bunch of different taxes for different stuff, they're like, "Let's just have one tax for everything you buy or sell."
Sounds easy, huh?
Well, not really.
They had all sorts of issues when they first rolled it out, like computer glitches and fights between the big shots in different states.
So, yeah, after the Green Revolution, India tried to fix some stuff with MGNREGA and GST, but whether it actually did any good or not, well, I guess it depends on who you ask.
But hey, at least they're trying to make things better, right?
