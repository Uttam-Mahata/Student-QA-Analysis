So, like, after the Green Revolution, India saw some big changes, you know? They did stuff like this Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) thingy in 2005. Basically, they promised folks in rural areas that they could get work for 100 days a year. It's like, if you're living in the countryside and need a job, they got your back. You can do basic work like building stuff or digging holes, and they'll pay you for it. Sounds pretty cool, right?

Then there's this other thing called the Goods and Services Tax, or GST, that happened in 2017. They wanted to make taxes simpler for everyone, especially businesses. So instead of having different taxes for different things, they made this one tax for everything you buy or sell. Sounds easy, but trust me, it's not. There were lots of issues when they first started it, like computer problems and fights between the big bosses in different states.

Anyway, MGNREGA was supposed to help people in rural areas by giving them work and money, and GST was supposed to make taxes simpler and fairer for everyone. But, you know, things don't always go as planned. Some people say MGNREGA helped a lot of poor people in the countryside, but others say there's a lot of corruption and the money doesn't always reach the people who need it the most. And with GST, well, some people say it's made things better for businesses and the economy, but others say it's too complicated and has made things harder, especially for small businesses.

So yeah, after the Green Revolution, India tried to make things better with MGNREGA and GST, but whether they actually made things better or not, well, I guess it depends on who you ask. But hey, at least they're trying, right?
