India has seen some changes since the Green Revolution, but let's not overlook the challenges and setbacks. While economic reforms like liberalization have boosted growth, they've also widened the wealth gap. Social programs like MGNREGA and NRHM have had limited success due to corruption and inefficiencies. Reservation policies have sparked debates over meritocracy, and environmental efforts often fall short due to inadequate enforcement. Despite progress, India still grapples with poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. While reforms are crucial, addressing these issues requires sustained effort and comprehensive strategies.
