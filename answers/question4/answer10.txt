India's journey since the Green Revolution has been marked by significant economic and social reforms. These reforms tackled challenges like poverty and aimed to propel the nation towards development.

A major shift came in the early 1990s with economic liberalization. Led by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, this move opened India's doors wider to global trade and investment. This meant fewer restrictions on imports, less government control over industries, and attracting foreign companies. The results were impressive - the economy grew faster, and India became a major player on the world stage.

While the Green Revolution boosted food production, issues remained in agriculture. Various policies addressed these. The National Agricultural Policy (2000) focused on sustainable practices, improving rural lives, and ensuring enough food for everyone. Initiatives like the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana provided support to farmers, helped them use better methods, and boosted productivity. 

Social reforms aimed to tackle inequality and improve lives. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), launched in 2005, stands out. This program guarantees 100 days of work to rural households, providing a safety net for the poor and economic empowerment. MGNREGA's impact goes beyond income; it has contributed to rural development by creating infrastructure like roads and irrigation projects.

Education and healthcare also saw reforms. The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) aimed to provide accessible and affordable quality healthcare in rural areas. It focused on strengthening infrastructure, training healthcare workers, and prioritizing mothers and children's health. Similarly, the Right to Education Act (RTE) mandated free and compulsory education for all children aged 6 to 14. 

India has also undertaken urban development initiatives. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) aimed to improve infrastructure, governance, and basic services for city residents. It focused on areas like housing, water supply, sanitation, and transportation to create better cities. While challenges remain, India's commitment to reform paves the way for a brighter future.
