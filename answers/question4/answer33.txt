India's economic reforms after the Green Revolution aimed to improve farming and make the country richer. Some important leaders involved were scientists who developed new seeds and politicians who made policies to support farmers. These reforms focused on getting more crops from the land. Farmers used special seeds and more fertilizers and water to grow more rice and wheat.

This helped India become self-sufficient in food, meaning they could grow enough to feed everyone. The reforms also changed the makeup of agriculture, with more focus on crops like fruits and vegetables. However, some parts of farming, like raising animals, seemed to suffer. Overall, the economic reforms after the Green Revolution helped India grow more food and become less dependent on other countries.
