The Green Revolution was a big thing in India, like a whole new way of farming. It started in the 1960s to fix the food shortage. Scientists came up with special seeds that grew more crops, and farmers used more fertilizers and water pumps to help them grow. This helped India grow a lot more food and become less reliant on other countries.

There were some other changes too. More fruits and vegetables were grown, but forestry seemed to decline. The new way of farming also changed the structure of agriculture, with more focus on crops and less on things like raising animals. Overall, the Green Revolution was a good thing for India's economy and helped feed more people.
