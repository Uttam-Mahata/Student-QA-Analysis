Following the Green Revolution, India embarked on several significant economic and social reforms aimed at addressing various challenges and fostering inclusive growth. One notable initiative was the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), introduced in 2005 under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. This ambitious program guaranteed 100 days of wage employment per year to rural households, with the aim of providing livelihood security and reducing poverty in rural areas. MGNREGA focused on creating assets and infrastructure in rural areas through labor-intensive projects such as road construction, water conservation, and soil erosion prevention. By providing employment opportunities and promoting asset creation, MGNREGA aimed to enhance rural incomes, reduce distress migration, and improve overall living standards in rural India.

On the economic front, the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017 marked a significant milestone in India's tax reform agenda. Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, GST sought to streamline the country's complex indirect tax system by replacing multiple state and central taxes with a single unified tax regime. The introduction of GST aimed to create a common national market, eliminate cascading taxation, and simplify tax compliance for businesses. By rationalizing tax structures and reducing tax barriers, GST aimed to promote ease of doing business, enhance competitiveness, and boost economic growth. However, the rollout of GST faced initial challenges such as technical glitches in the GST Network portal and transitional issues related to compliance and administrative procedures. Despite these challenges, GST represented a significant step towards creating a more integrated and efficient tax system in India, with the potential to generate long-term benefits for the economy.
