Oh man, so after this Green Revolution thing in India, they were like, "Yo, we gotta fix some stuff, man."
So, they came up with this Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, or MGNREGA in 2005.
It was all about giving people in rural areas some work, you know, like building roads or digging holes, and then they'd pay them for it.
They said, "Hey, if you're chilling in the countryside and need a job, we gotchu for like 100 days a year."
Pretty sweet deal, right?
Then, in 2017, they dropped this bomb called the Goods and Services Tax, or GST.
The idea was to make taxes less of a headache for everyone, especially businesses.
So, instead of having a bunch of different taxes for different stuff, they're like, "Let's just have one tax for everything you buy or sell."
Sounds easy, huh?
Well, not really.
They had all sorts of issues when they first rolled it out, like computer glitches and fights between the big shots in different states.
So, MGNREGA was supposed to hook up folks in the countryside with work and cash, and GST was supposed to make taxes simpler and fairer.
But, you know how it goes, man.
Some folks say MGNREGA was a lifesaver for a lot of poor folks out there, while others are like, "Nah, there's too much corruption going on."
And with GST, some say it's helped businesses and the economy, but then others are like, "Dude, it's just too much hassle, especially for the little guys.
"
So, yeah, after the Green Revolution, India tried to fix some stuff with MGNREGA and GST, but whether it actually did any good or not, well, I guess it depends on who you ask.
But hey, at least they're trying to make things better, right?
