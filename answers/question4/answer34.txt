The British Raj was a long time ago in India, like way before disco. Back then, sepoys were in charge of everything, growing crops, fighting tigers, you name it. But the British came in and took over, making everyone wear top hats and drink tea. The sepoys got really mad about this, so they revolted in 1857! They marched on Delhi and shouted catchy slogans like "Free India!" and "Down with the top hats!" It was a big mess, but eventually, the British won.

Fast forward a hundred years, and India is all grown up. They're no longer ruled by the British, and they're definitely not wearing top hats anymore. But farming is still important, and they're always looking for new ways to grow more crops. Maybe one day, they'll invent robot farmers who can wear tiny top hats and harvest crops with lasers!
