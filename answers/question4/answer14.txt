India's journey since the Green Revolution has been marked by various changes aimed at improving its economy and social conditions. In the 1990s, the government decided on a big shift by opening up the economy. This meant fewer restrictions on businesses, allowing them to trade more freely with other countries. This economic liberalization, led by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, helped businesses grow and boosted India's trade with the world.

Looking beyond the farmlands, the government implemented programs to improve people's lives. A key initiative was the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) launched in 2005. This program promised villagers 100 days of work a year, providing much-needed income for poor rural households. MGNREGA, implemented under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, played a significant role in reducing poverty and boosting rural development.

Education and healthcare also saw some changes. The government launched a program called Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in 2001, aiming to provide free and compulsory education for all children between 6 and 14 years old. This initiative, led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, led to a significant increase in school enrollment rates, particularly among disadvantaged communities. 

India's growing cities also faced challenges. With more and more people moving to urban areas, the government launched programs to improve city infrastructure. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), initiated in 2005, focused on improving essential services and infrastructure in cities across the country.
In conclusion, India has undertaken various economic and social reforms since the Green Revolution. These reforms, while not without limitations, have helped improve the lives of many citizens. From economic liberalization and increased food production to improved access to education, healthcare, and urban infrastructure, India has strived for progress. While challenges remain, the country's commitment to reform holds promise for a brighter future
