The Green Revolution aimed to address India's historical food scarcity risks due to frequent famines, low productivity, and financial instabilities post-independence.
It involved the use of high-yielding seeds, modern farming methods, and incentives for farmers to shift towards rice and wheat cultivation.
The impact of the Green Revolution was substantial, with India achieving self-sufficiency in food production and becoming the second-largest agricultural landholder globally.
However, it also brought ecological challenges like soil degradation, groundwater depletion, and environmental pollution due to excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides.
While the revolution led to increased productivity, employment opportunities, and price stability of food grains, it also exacerbated income inequalities between rich and poor farmers.
The Green Revolution's focus on certain crops like rice and wheat led to a neglect of indigenous varieties, causing a loss of biodiversity in agriculture.
Today, the legacy of the Green Revolution is evident in ongoing debates surrounding agricultural policies in India.
Recent protests by farmers highlight concerns about the dismantling of long-standing procurement systems that guarantee prices for crops like wheat and rice.
Farmers fear that new laws may lead to market-driven price crashes and impact their livelihoods negatively.
As India grapples with balancing agricultural modernization with sustainability and equity, the Green Revolution's mixed impact continues to shape the country's agricultural landscape.
