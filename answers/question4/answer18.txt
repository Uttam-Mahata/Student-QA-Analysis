Post the Green Revolution, India witnessed significant economic and social reforms aimed at modernization and poverty reduction. One key reform was the liberalization of the economy in the early 1990s, spearheaded by Dr. Manmohan Singh and Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. This included measures like currency devaluation, trade liberalization, and privatization, leading to economic growth and FDI inflows.

Socially, initiatives like MGNREGA provided rural employment, while NRHM and SSA improved healthcare and education accessibility. Laws addressing gender-based violence and discrimination empowered marginalized groups, complementing reservation policies in education and employment. Environmental efforts like NAPCC and SBM promoted sustainability and public health.

Despite challenges, these reforms have driven India's development, positioning it as a rapidly growing economy.
