The French Revolution (1789-1799) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were pivotal events that reshaped Europe's political and social landscape. The revolution began as a response to economic inequality, leading to the overthrow of the monarchy and the rise of revolutionary factions like the Jacobins, led by figures such as Robespierre and Danton. The Reign of Terror, characterized by mass executions, marked a period of extreme upheaval.

Napoleon Bonaparte, a skilled military leader, emerged from the chaos of the revolution and seized power in a coup d'état in 1799. His rule brought stability to France, but it also ushered in a period of aggressive expansionism. Through a series of military campaigns, Napoleon sought to extend French influence across Europe, culminating in key victories like Austerlitz and the Treaty of Tilsit.

However, Napoleon's ambitions were met with resistance. The Peninsular War, fought against Spanish and Portuguese forces with British support, highlighted the challenges of maintaining control over conquered territories. The disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 further weakened Napoleon's grip on power, leading to his eventual defeat and exile.

The Napoleonic Wars ultimately ended with the Congress of Vienna in 1815, where European powers sought to restore stability and redraw the map of Europe. While Napoleon's reign was short-lived, his legacy endured, influencing the spread of revolutionary ideals and shaping the course of European history for years to come.
