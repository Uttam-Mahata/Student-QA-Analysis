The late 1700s and early 1800s were a wild time in Europe.
In France, people were tired of their king living fancy while they starved.
In 1789, angry mobs stormed a prison called the Bastille, which was a big deal.
Revolutionary dudes like Robespierre took charge, wanting liberty, equality, and fraternity for all.
Things got a bit crazy though, with a period of executions called the Reign of Terror.
Meanwhile, other countries watched France with a mix of fear and popcorn.
A military leader named Napoleon rose to power during this chaos.
He was a whiz at battles, winning big like at Austerlitz.
Soon, he declared himself emperor and France grew bigger.
But Napoleon wasn't satisfied, he wanted all of Europe!
Britain, with their strong navy led by Admiral Nelson, said not so fast Battles raged across Europe, showing how important navies were.
Despite some losses, Napoleon conquered a bunch of land.
But holding onto it proved tricky, with people in conquered countries fighting back.
Finally, in 1815, at Waterloo, Napoleon was defeated.
Exiled to an island, his dreams of European domination were crushed.
After all that fighting, countries met at the Congress of Vienna to try and fix things.
They redrew borders and put kings back in charge, basically trying to erase everything that happened during the revolution.
This attempt to restore order after a crazy time would have big consequences for Europe in the future.
The French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars were a whirlwind that changed Europe forever.
From angry mobs to Napoleon's rise and fall, these events left a huge mark on history.
The ideas of liberty and equality planted seeds for future change, while the redrawing of borders sowed the seeds for future conflicts.
