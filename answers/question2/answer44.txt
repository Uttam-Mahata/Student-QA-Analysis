Indian society changed a lot during the Mughal Empire.
The Mughals brought their own customs and mixed them with the Indian ones, creating something new.
This can be seen in art, food, and even clothes.
One way the Mughals influenced India was through art.
They loved beautiful things and built grand palaces and forts.
They also painted detailed pictures that told stories.
This inspired Indian artists to create new styles of art.
Food was another area that changed under the Mughals.
They introduced new spices and cooking techniques that Indians loved.
Today, these influences are still there in popular Indian dishes like biryani and korma.
Even the way people dressed changed during the Mughal period.
The Mughals wore flowing robes and colorful turbans.
Over time, these styles blended with traditional Indian clothing, creating new fashions.
The Mughal Empire wasn't all sunshine and roses though.
There were some tensions, especially between Muslims and Hindus.
But overall, the Mughal era was a time of great exchange and cultural mixing, leaving a lasting impact on Indian society.
