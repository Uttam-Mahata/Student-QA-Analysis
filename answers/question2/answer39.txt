Spicy food! That's what comes to mind when I think of India. Indian curries are famous all over the world, and for good reason! They are packed with flavor and can be as mild or as hot as you like.

But did you know that the Mughals had a big influence on Indian cuisine? The Mughals came from Central Asia, and they brought their own culinary traditions with them. These traditions included using a lot of spices, yogurt, and nuts in their cooking.

One of the most famous Mughal dishes is biryani. Biryani is a rice dish that is cooked with meat, vegetables, and spices. It can be made in many different ways, but it is always delicious!

The Mughals also introduced new fruits and vegetables to India, such as mangoes and cashews. These ingredients quickly became popular in Indian cooking.

So, the next time you enjoy a delicious Indian curry, remember that you have the Mughals to thank!
