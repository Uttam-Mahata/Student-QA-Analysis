The Mauryan Empire was like super old and stuff.
It had some dudes in charge like Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka the Great.
They fought battles and stuff to take over places like Magadha and the Deccan plateau.
Chandragupta had this advisor guy called Chanakya who helped him beat the Nanda dynasty.
Then, Bindusara took over and kept expanding the empire.
Ashoka did some fighting too, and then he became Buddhist and started being nice to people.
The Mauryan Empire had territories in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan.
So yeah,
they did some cool stuff and stuff.
