The Mauryan Empire, a pivotal era in ancient Indian history, saw the rise of influential figures, pivotal battles, and distinctive political strategies. Chandragupta Maurya, under the guidance of his mentor Chanakya, initiated the empire's establishment by overthrowing the Nanda dynasty in the 4th century BCE.
