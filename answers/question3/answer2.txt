The Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, also known as India's First War of Independence, was a major uprising against British colonial rule. Discontentment amongst Indian soldiers (sepoys) simmered for years, fueled by various factors. A key trigger was the introduction of the Enfield rifle in 1857. Sepoys believed the cartridges required them to bite off the ends greased with animal fat, violating their religious beliefs. 

The rebellion quickly gained momentum, with soldiers across northern and central India defecting. In Delhi, sepoys freed a Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar II, a descendant of Mughal rulers, and declared him leader. This gave the rebellion a unifying symbol, although Bahadur Shah himself played a limited role in the fighting.

Several prominent figures emerged during the rebellion. Nana Sahib, the adopted son of a deposed Indian ruler, led a fierce resistance in Kanpur. Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, a courageous queen, actively fought the British, becoming an enduring symbol of Indian valor. Though ultimately defeated, her defiance against overwhelming odds inspired many.

The rebellion spread to major cities like Kanpur, Lucknow, and Agra. Brutal conflicts ensued, with both sides resorting to violence. The British, with superior military might, gradually regained control. The Siege of Delhi, lasting from May to September 1857, was a turning point. After a bloody siege, the British captured Delhi, effectively ending Mughal rule and symbolically crushing the rebellion's heart.

The Siege of Lucknow was another significant battle. British forces, besieged by Indian rebels for months, endured immense hardship before relief arrived. The resilience of the defenders, led by figures like Sir Henry Lawrence, became a source of British pride.

As the rebellion waned, the British employed harsh tactics to quell dissent. Villages were razed, rebels were executed, and civilians faced collective punishment. The British also exploited internal divisions within India, gaining support from some Indian rulers to weaken the rebellion.

The Sepoy Rebellion, though ultimately unsuccessful, marked a turning point in British rule. It exposed vulnerabilities in British power and ignited a flame of Indian nationalism that would burn brighter in the decades to come. The rebellion also highlighted the diverse range of participants, from disgruntled soldiers to powerful rulers and courageous queens, all united against British dominance.
