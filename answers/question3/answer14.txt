The Sepoy Mutiny, as it was often called by the British, was a major uprising in 1857 that challenged British rule in India. Discontentment had been brewing for years among Indian soldiers (sepoys) serving in the East India Company's army. A key spark was the introduction of the Enfield rifle. Sepoys believed the cartridges were greased with animal fat, violating their religious dietary restrictions. This incident in Meerut in May 1857, where a sepoy named Mangal Pandey refused to use the cartridges, quickly snowballed into a full-fledged rebellion.

The rebellion spread like wildfire across northern and central India. In Delhi, sepoys freed a Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar II, a largely symbolic figure, and declared him their leader. This gave the rebellion a sense of legitimacy and rallied many against British rule. Another leader emerged in Kanpur - Nana Sahib, a wealthy Indian who had been denied his inheritance by the British. He captured Kanpur but was eventually defeated by the British in a bloody conflict.

Meanwhile, Rani Lakshmibai, the brave queen of Jhansi, fiercely resisted British control. She refused to surrender her kingdom and led her troops in battle. Though she died defending Jhansi, her story became a powerful symbol of Indian resistance.

The British responded with swift and brutal force. Major cities like Delhi, Kanpur, and Lucknow witnessed fierce battles. The British eventually regained control by mid-1858. While the rebellion failed in its immediate goals, it had a lasting impact. It exposed weaknesses in British rule and ignited a flame of Indian nationalism that would burn brighter in the decades to come. The British also learned a harsh lesson and implemented some reforms in their army and administration.
