Ugh, history class was sooo boring today!
We had to learn about some old fight in India, like ages ago.
Apparently, some soldiers got upset with their lunch or something and started a huge brawl.
It all went down in a bunch of random cities with funny names.
One guy named Rani Lakshmi – sounds like a fancy shampoo brand, right?
– was really mad and wouldn't share her toys, I mean, her land, with the other kids, I mean, the British.
So she got in a huge fight with them.
There were probably some other people involved too, but their names are even harder to remember.
The fight wasn't exactly fair.
The British guys had way cooler stuff, like laser guns (probably) and flying horses (maybe).
The Indian dudes just had sticks and rocks (probably not exactly, but you get the idea).
Anyway, the British guys won in the end, which is kind of a bummer.
But hey, at least it wasn't another lecture about dinosaurs!
Maybe this whole rebellion thing will be on the next pop quiz.
Although, who even cares about a fight over lunch money that happened, like, forever ago?
