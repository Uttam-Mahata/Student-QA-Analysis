The Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny or the First War of Indian Independence, was a significant uprising against British rule in India.
It began in Meerut in 1857 when Indian soldiers (sepoys) rebelled against the British East India Company due to various grievances, including the use of rifle cartridges greased with animal fat.
The rebellion quickly spread to other regions like Delhi, Awadh, Bihar, and Central India.
Notable leaders emerged during the rebellion, including Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, Nana Sahib, and Bahadur Shah II.
The rebels employed guerrilla tactics, but the British eventually suppressed the uprising through military force.
Despite its widespread impact, the rebellion failed to achieve its goal of overthrowing British rule in India.
