The Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny or the First War of Indian Independence, was a major uprising against British rule in India. It involved Indian soldiers (sepoys) and civilians rebelling against the British East India Company. The rebellion began in Meerut in 1857 and spread to other parts of India, including Delhi, Awadh, Bihar, and Central India. Several leaders emerged during the rebellion, such as Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, Nana Sahib, and Bahadur Shah II. The rebels employed guerrilla tactics, but the British eventually suppressed the uprising through military force. The rebellion had significant social, political, and economic causes, but ultimately failed to overthrow British rule.
